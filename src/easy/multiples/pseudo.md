# Pseudo Code Solution

const functionName = (first number indicating start point/multiple value, second number indicating the number of multiples to include in array) => {
    let arrayName = emptyarray
    let variableName = 0;
    (Loop through all the numbers, starting at first number, stopping when greater than the value of (first number * second number) and increasing in increments of the first number for each loop) {
        Let the value assigned to variableName increase by the value of the first number
        Push the new value of the variableName into the array
    }
    Log the filled array to the console
}

Run the function to test it
