# Pseudo Code Solution
Create 2 lists of numbers, both from 1-12.
Take the first number in the first list and multiply by every number in the second list. Put the resulting products into a new list.
Repeat for every number in the first list.
Split the resulting single list, containing the products of all above calculations, into 12 equal lists containing 12 numbers each and representing the products associated with each individual number.
